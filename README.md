Overview:
The Hospital Management System is a console-based application that simplifies hospital operations. Developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, particularly Inheritance, this system aims to streamline patient management, In-Patient Department, payment history and Number of days Admitted and record-keeping processes in a hospital.

Key Features:
Patient Management: Track patient details, admission/discharge information, and payment records.
In-Patient Department: Track the ward number and Bed number records
In-Patient Department Patient: Track the how many days patient were admitted in the hospital.
Inheritance-based Structure: Uses inheritance to reduce code redundancy and improve modularity. Different roles, such as patients, IPD, and IPD Patient, inherit common properties and methods, facilitating better organization.
Project Structure
The main classes in this system are:

Person: Base class with common attributes (e.g., name, age, contact info) shared among all people in the system.
Patient: Inherits from Person, includes health-specific details and payment history.
IPD: Inherits from the Patient class and have details of ward no., and bed no.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: [C++, Inheritance)]
IDE/Platform: [VS code]
